                    it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                    sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                    PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
